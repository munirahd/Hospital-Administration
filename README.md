# Hospital Administration üè•

## Overview
This project entails the development of a basic Java application for hospital administration. It's designed to manage various aspects such as employee records, patient details, and hospital services.

### Functionalities:
1. **Admin Information Management:**
   - Reading an admin file containing all administrator information.
   - Signing in an administrator if their details are found.

2. **Navigation Options:**
   - Upon successful login, the admin is presented with multiple management options:
     1. **Staff Management:**
        - Add Employees (Doctors, Nurses, Admins)
        - Print Employee Information (Doctors, Nurses, Admins)
        - Exit to Main Menu
     2. **Patient Management:**
        - Register New Patients
        - Print Patient Information
        - Generate and Print Patient Bills
        - Exit to Main Menu
     3. **Service Management:**
        - Add New Services
        - Print Service Information
        - Print Doctor Services
        - Exit to Main Menu
     4. **Program Termination:**
        - Exit the program.

3. **Addition and Printing Functions:**
   - **Addition:** Input and store information for new entities (employees, patients, services).
   - **Printing:** Display information for existing entities (e.g., doctors, patients) in the output panel.

4. **Exit Command:** Terminates the program.

### UML Diagram

## Purpose
This project was developed as part of an object-oriented programming class. The key goals were:
- Applying OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, exception handling, and Collections.
- Integrating these concepts in a practical, real-world application scenario.
